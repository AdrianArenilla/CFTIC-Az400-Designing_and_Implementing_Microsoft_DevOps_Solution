## Lab 01: Agile Planning and Portfolio Management with Azure Boards
In this lab, we'll learn about the agile portfolio management and planning processes and tools that Azure Boards provide and how they can help you quickly plan, manage, and track the work of your entire team. Explore product backlog, sprint backlog, and task boards that can be used to track workflow over the course of an iteration. We'll also see how the tools in this release have been enhanced to scale to larger teams and organizations.
