## Lab 19: Implement Security and Compliance in an Azure DevOps pipeline
In this lab, you will use WhiteSource Bolt with Azure DevOps to automatically detect vulnerable open source components, outdated libraries, and license compliance issues in your code. You will leverage WebGoat, an intentionally insecure web application, maintained by OWASP designed to illustrate common web application security issues.
