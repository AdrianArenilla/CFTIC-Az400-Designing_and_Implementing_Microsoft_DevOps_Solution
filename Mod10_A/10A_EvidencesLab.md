If the result is Fail, wait for the next evaluation. 

This indicates that there are active work items. These work items need to be closed in order to proceed further. Next sampling time will be after 5 minutes.

List the resource groups created in the lab for this module by running the following command:
```
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m10l01-RG')].name" --output tsv
```

Delete the resource groups that you created in the lab for this module by executing the following command:
```
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m10l01-RG')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
