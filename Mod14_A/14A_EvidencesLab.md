## Lab 14A: Ansible with Azure
In this lab we will deploy, configure, and manage Azure resources by using Ansible.

### [Go to lab instructions -->](AZ400_M14_Ansible_with_Azure.md)


Run the code to specify the name of the Azure region that will host the resources you deploy and create resource groups that will host the Azure VMs you deploy.

Run the code to create the virtual network and its subnet into which you will deploy an Azure VM by using an ansible playbook.
![](Evidences/Image13.png)


Run the code to deploy the sample ansible playbook that provisions an Azure VM.

Create a new file named myazure_rm.yml, open it in the Nano text editor and paste the content.
![](Evidences/Image15.png)


Run the code to perform a ping test, verifying that the dynamic inventory file includes the newly deployed Azure VM.
![](Evidences/Image16.png)


Run the code to identify the public IP address of the newly deployed Azure VM (PIP), run the code to verify that the newly deployed Azure VM is currently not running any web service (curl http://$PIP) and run the following to install the HTTP service by using the Ansible playbook (sudo ansible-playbook).
![](Evidences/Image17.png)


Run the code to verify that the newly deployed Azure VM is now running a web service.

List the resource groups created in the lab for this module by running the following command:
```
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m14l03')].name" --output tsv
```

Delete the resource groups that you created in the lab for this module by executing the following command:
```
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m14l03')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
```
