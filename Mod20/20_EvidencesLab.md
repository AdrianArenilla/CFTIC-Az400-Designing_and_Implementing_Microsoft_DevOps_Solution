Create a new pipeline.
![](Evidences/Image13.png)


Create a new service connection.
![](Evidences/Image14.png)


Choose SonarCloud to connect to it.
![](Evidences/Image15.png)


Verify that the SonarCloud token is valid and choose a service connection name.
![](Evidences/Image16.png)


Modify the azure-pipelines.yml file and click on Save and run.
![](Evidences/Image17.png)


Monitor its progress and verify that it completes successfully. 
![](Evidences/Image18.png)


Create a new pipeline but now choose classic editor.
![](Evidences/Image19.png)


The source is Azure Repos Git and check the rest of the options and Continue.
![](Evidences/Image20.png)


Choose .NET Desktop with SonarCloud template and Apply.
![](Evidences/Image21.png)


Create a new service connection within the task Prepare analysis on SonarCloud verifying the SonarCloud token.
![](Evidences/Image22.png)


Set up the options of pipeline. 
![](Evidences/Image23.png)


Monitor its progress and verify that it completes successfully. 
![](Evidences/Image24.png)


To be able to see the Quality gate result, after running he first report we need to set New Code Definition. This way, subsequent pipeline runs will include Quality Gate results.
![](Evidences/Image25.png)


Choose Previous version.
![](Evidences/Image26.png)


Monitor its progress and verify that it completes successfully. 
![](Evidences/Image27.png)

Configure pull request integration in SonarCloud.
![](Evidences/Image32.png)


Configure pull request integration in SonarCloud.
![](Evidences/Image33.png)


On the **Program.cs** pane, add the following empty method to the code directly above the line `public static bool AlwaysReturnsTrue()` and Commit.
```
public void Unused(){}
```
