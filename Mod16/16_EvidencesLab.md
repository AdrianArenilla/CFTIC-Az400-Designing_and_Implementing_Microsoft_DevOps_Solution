List the resource groups created in the lab for this module by running the following command:
```
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m16l01a-RG')].name" --output tsv
```

Delete the resource groups that you created in the lab for this module by executing the following command:
```
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m16l01a-RG')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
